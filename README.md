At the top of the page there is a recognisable type of navigation bar with website name on the left side and the navigation links to the right of it. The navigation bar also contains a search bar and login and register buttons when logged out and a friendly welcome message and sign ut button when authenticated. The menu collapses to hamburger icon on smaller screen sizes. At the bottom of the page there is a footer with links to social media pages(opening in a separate tab/window).

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| The post method on the date selector did not work properly | Renamed function to 'post', removed 'if request.method == "POST":'. Also standardised the nomenclature of files - changed â€˜-â€˜ to â€˜_â€™ |
| The session ID for the planner could not be obtained | Changed `"request.session[workout_plan.pk] = workout_plan.id"` into `"request.session['workout_plan.id'] = workout_plan.pk"` |
| Unable to save forms from formset due to row containing null values | Added properties to WorkoutPlan models (blank=True, null=False, default='',) |
| Validation:  button being a descendant of an element and vice-versa `(e.g. <a href="/planner"><button type="button" class="button">start now</button></a>` | Made an a tag with a class of link-button (`<a href="/planner" class="link-button mt-2">start now</a>`)|
| Duplicated code of exercise filters with its appearence on the page was set with CSS and media queries which was causing html errors due to duplicated ID tags | Removed duplicated code and wrote JavaScript function to adjust filter drop-down and functionality on the smaller screens |
| Validation: wave tool identified 3 errors due to no labels to input fields | Fixed by adding labels and setting bootstrap class to sr-only |
| Validation: wave tool identified 28 errors for missing form fields labels in add plan and edit plan page | Added labels with no visibility set |
| Validation: error identified for missing 1st table header field | Added value to the th element and set 'visibility: none'; |
| Validation: wave tool identified a few error for empty links of navigation icons | Added aria-hidden='true' and set bootstrap class to sr-only |
| Testing: no email address shown on email from logged-in user who had to manually input their address to the field on the contact form | Amended view to display contact form in views.py by adding nested if function in `if request.user.is_authenticated` |
