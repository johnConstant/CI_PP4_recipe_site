The navigation bar also contains a search bar and login and register buttons when logged out and a friendly welcome message and sign ut button when authenticated. The menu collapses to hamburger icon on smaller screen sizes. At the bottom of the page there is a footer with links to social media pages(opening in a separate tab/window).
